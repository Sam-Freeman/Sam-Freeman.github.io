            <h2>Introduction - Numero Uno</h2><h3> {18/02/17}</h3>
            <p>My name is Samuel Freeman. I'm an 18 year old high school senior, I enjoy programming, and solving problems - problems I usually create. For more about me you can go to my <a href="aboutme.html">About Me</a> page. I'm currently on Crocus?, yeah Crocus break. As an IB student, the term "break" is thrown around quite loosely to be honest. In my view, a break is not a break from work, but just a change of location. There is not a decrease in the amount of work, in fact the work load probably increases.<br><br>I'm currently in England going to university visit days and interviews. I find the visit days rather strange in all honesty, well the ones without the interviews. From most universities, the tag line is usually along the lines of "come and see why you should choose us". I've already done this, it's why I applied haha, and yea I understand it's to do with placement on the UCAS application, but I still find it not fully necessary.<br><br>You may be wondering why have I started this blog. The main purpose of this blog is to discuss my progress on different projects, and from time to time, complain about the IB. After this post, I will post seperately for each project that is currently on my GitHub account, and explain its purpose and current stage. As I continue to work on projects (including this blog and website as a whole), and come up with more ideas, I will add posts. Its also a place where I can do some brainstorming too and perhaps add some parts of my life - who knows.</p>
