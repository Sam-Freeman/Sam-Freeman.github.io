          <p data-text-description="Shape Master is a game that was developed as part of Ludum Dare 35 - where the theme was shape
          shifting. The game was originally built in under 72 hours, in partnership with Lyndon (Wei-Mao) Fan who designed
          a large proportion of the graphics. If you wish to download the game, you can do so here. Although
          I have not worked on this in a while, I am planning to come back to it in the near future. This game
          was built using the LibGDX library."></p>
